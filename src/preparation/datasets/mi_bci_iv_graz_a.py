At the beginning of a trial (t = 0 s), a fixation cross appeared on the black screen. After two seconds (t = 2 s), a cue in the form of an arrow pointing either to the left, right, down or up (corresponding to one of the four classes left hand, right hand, foot or tongue) appeared and stayed on the screen for 1.25s. This prompted the subjects to perform the desired motor imagery task. No feedback was provided. The subjects were ask to carry out the motor imagery task until the fixation cross disappeared from the screen at t = 6s.'
